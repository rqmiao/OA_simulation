# Example Run Scripts

These are example job scripts for GCHP batch jobs. You should write your own, but these are good
templates to start from. 

You can find simple examples for various schedulers in `runScriptSamples/simple_examples`.
Currently, we have examples for Slurm, PBS, and LSF. You can find system-specific examples in
`runScriptSamples/simple_examples`. Currently we have examples for Pleiades (NASA), Cannon
(Harvard), and Compute1 (WUSTL).

You can find "full-fledged" examples in `runScriptSamples/operational_examples`. These are more
complicated, but they demonstrate what some operational GCHP job scripts look like. Initially, it's
probably best to err on the side of simplicity, and build your own automated functionality with
time.
